OrangeHRM integrated with NIO Module

This is OrangeHRM 2.5 beta version.

Working for a company integrated a module that helped that keep 
track of people who worked from home, employee coming in without their 
swype cards etc. So they could use this module to apply for attendance
for such situations. It doesn't use MVC concept.
